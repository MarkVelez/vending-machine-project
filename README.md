# Passively Cooled Honey Vending Machine

This project was a graduation project for HTL Spengergasse. The goal of the project was to build a functioning vending machine that would store jars of honey underground and be kept at a relatively constant temperature all year round with minimal power consumption.


## Team

The team consisted of three students including myself. We were all split into our corresponding roles:

- Construction of the vending machine hardware including electronics.
- Programming of the systems responsible for the operation of the vending machine.
- Outer design of the vending machine and modernization of the existing customer website.
